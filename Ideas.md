-  **Description when you have no mods.**
	Sine should have a description for the "Installed Mods" section when you have no mods that will say, "You do not have any mods installed. [How do I install a mod?](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine/wiki/)"
	
	This will provide a link to explain to new users how to install mods, as well as provide a little bit of company for users who have no mods installed.
