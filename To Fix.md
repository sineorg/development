-  [UI bugged after the latest 1.16b update in zen · Issue #289 · CosmoCreeper/Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine/issues/289)
	The marketplace items overflow and do not fit their container in the latest release of Firefox/Zen.
	
	For future purposes, I think this should be fixed by adding an ellipsis to the end of the description of every mod that does not fit its container. I also believe that the expanded marketplace should behave differently and allow for infinite scrolling instead of pagination, but this would require splitting the code of the two sections apart.
